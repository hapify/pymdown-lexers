# Hapify PyMdown Lexers

A package created to add additional Hapify lexers for use in Pygments. 
This package was created to be used in the [PyMdown project](https://github.com/facelessuser/PyMdown), but it can be used by anyone who wants to add the contained styles to Pygments.

## Overview

The purpose of this package was to natively add the lexers to Pygments via a plugin.  This was so that PyMdown could use 3rd party and native lexers without having to directly modify a Pygments installation.

## Included Lexers

| Lexers | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| hapify | A simple lexer used in PyMdown documents to highlight Hapify syntax keywords and tags. |
